# Common Driver Files

This does nothing on its own. It contains the header files that must be implemented for each platform
SuperHaxagon supports, along with some functions shared between drivers. It cannot be built directly.

(It's named All to sort at the top, since all drivers must implement these files)

## Using In Another Project

You'll probably want to change the namespace from SuperHaxagon to your own project's namespace when copying
these files.
