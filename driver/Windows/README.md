# Windows Driver

This driver supports Windows with SFML2 as a backend.

## Building

Windows is (probably) the easiest platform to build for!

1. Install Visual Studio https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/
2. Open the root folder
3. Press "Play"

You can probably also use the "Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt" to generate
a Ninja or vcproj file directly, if needed, but I find just opening the folder to
be the easiest.

## License

This driver follows the license scheme of the parent driver at `driver/SFML`.
