# Licenses

This driver uses the following libraries, which are licensed with the following terms:

## Nspire Driver

* Directory: files in `driver/Nspire`
* License: GPLv3-or-later (or MIT)
* Copyright © 2021 AJ Walter

## Ndless

* Website: https://ndless.me/
* Source: https://github.com/ndless-nspire/Ndless
* License: Varies
  * Headers: Public Domain  
    https://github.com/ndless-nspire/Ndless/blob/master/ndless-sdk/include/LICENSE.txt
  * Implementation: MPL-1.1

_Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer_

The Ndless source MPL-1.1 license may be technically incompatible with the GPLv3 given my limited research due to the
additional restrictions it places on sharing statically linked binaries, which the GPLv3 disallows. 

I'm going to invoke _The Rule of Cool™_ here and assume that the intent of creating public domain headers while keeping
the source licensed under MPL-1.1 is intended so that target applications can use any license, including none. In this
case, I believe a strong copyleft requirement is within the spirit of Ndless and the calculator community as a whole.
