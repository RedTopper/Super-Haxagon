# ![Icon](./media/icon-3ds.png "Icon") Super-Haxagon

Super Haxagon is a cross platform, open source [Super Hexagon](http://superhexagon.com/) clone for the Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo Switch, Windows, Linux, and the [TI-Nspire](https://education.ti.com/en/products/calculators/graphing-calculators/ti-nspire-cx-cas) (yes, the calculator). It is developed in C++ and uses no additional libraries for the core logic, making it easy (in theory) to port to new platforms. It also has a GUI based level editor called [Haxa Editor](https://github.com/RedTopper/Haxa-Editor).

## Download

You can download the latest build on [the releases page](https://github.com/RedTopper/Super-Haxagon/releases) to the right.

_Warning: The windows/linux versions requires a graphics adapter with OpenGL 3.2 or higher. Super Haxagon may be unsupported on first generation Intel processors, Remote Desktop sessions, or VMs with no hardware acceleration. See #22 for details._

## Features

 * Cross Platform
 * Widescreen support
 * High Refresh Rate support
 * Custom Levels
 * OGG decoder for BGM
 * High Score Saving

## Building

Super Haxagon targets the 3DS, Switch, Windows (MinGW + MSVC), and Linux. For desktop platforms, it uses a cross platform library called SFML, so it will probably also compile on other platforms that support it.

1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/RedTopper/Super-Haxagon.git --recursive`

### 3DS Build

1. Get MinGW and DevkitPro and install dependencies listed in the Makefile
1. Use the provided Makefile with the command `make TARGET:=3DS`
1. Install either the CIA or 3DSX on your 3DS

### Switch Build

1. Get MinGW and DevkitPro and install dependencies listed in the Makefile
1. Use the provided Makefile with the command `make TARGET:=SWITCH`
1. Copy the .nro to `sdmc:/switch/SuperHaxagon/SuperHaxagon.nro` and launch it from the hbmenu

### TI-Nspire Build

1. On Linux (I use WSL/Ubuntu), get and build [Ndless](https://github.com/ndless-nspire/Ndless)
1. Use the provided Makefile.nspire with the command `make -f Makefile.nspire`
1. Copy `haxagon.tns` to the ndless folder
1. Rename `levels.haxagon` to `levels.haxagon.tns` and copy it to the ndless folder

### PC Build

#### ... with MSVC on Windows

1. Note: you may need the [Visual C++ Runtime](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)
1. Download SFML for your MSVC version
1. Rename the SFML folder to `SFML-MSVC` and place it in libraries
1. Use Visual Studio to open a folder with the CMake file
1. Build the game
1. Press play

#### ... with MinGW/msys on Windows

1. Note: you may need the [Visual C++ Runtime](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)
1. Download SFML for your MinGW version
1. Rename the SFML folder to `SFML-MinGW` and place it in libraries
1. Use the provided Makefile with the command `make TARGET:=WIN64` OR use the CMake file
1. Copy the `romfs` folder and `SFML/bin/openal32.dll` library next to the built executable (only needed with Makefile)
1. Launch the executable

#### ... with GCC on Linux

1. Install SFML through your distro's package manager
1. Clone this repository
1. Use the CMake file or Makefile `make TARGET:=LINUX64` to build it
1. Launch the executable

## Cross Platform

Below are a few screenshots featuring the various platforms that Super Haxagon compiles on. The 3DS version is packaged with a custom 3D banner to make it look official. Additionally, the gif was recorded on actual Nintendo Switch hardware.
